## Summary

This public research mock defines a governance structure for responsible AI development and operation.
It provides an illustrative, non-commercial framework showing how roles, review gates, and audit evidence can be organized within an ethical and secure AI lifecycle.
The document intentionally omits implementation logic, internal prompts, or private controls.
It aligns with established cybersecurity frameworks and best practices (e.g., NIST SP 800-171 concepts) without asserting certification or compliance.

---

## Purpose

* Demonstrate how AI governance structures can embed accountability, risk review, and traceable decision-making.
* Provide a reusable reference for educational and research purposes under PNCRL-1.0.
* Encourage secure-by-default design, transparent review, and verifiable audit evidence.
* License: PNCRL-1.0 — non-commercial research use only.

---

## Scope and Principles

* **Scope** - Covers governance processes, roles, and audit artifacts. No operational logic, secrets, or production code included.
* **Principles** - Verification over inference, minimal disclosure, clear audit trail, reproducibility at process level, and separation of duties.
* **Alignment** - NIST SP 800-171 concepts.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Primary Accountability                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Owner**       | Defines purpose, risk scope, and approves release gates.            |
| **Data Steward**      | Maintains lawful sources, documentation, and retention controls.    |
| **Security Reviewer** | Validates isolation, threat assumptions, and audit logging posture. |
| **Privacy Reviewer**  | Ensures minimization and subject-rights safeguards.                 |
| **Audit Lead**        | Confirms evidence completeness and reproducibility of reviews.      |
| **Operations Lead**   | Coordinates change windows and rollback conditions.                 |

## Governance Lifecycle

1. **Intake** - Register project metadata, purpose, risk rating, and threat overview.
2. **Data Governance** - Define sources, transforms, and retention. Publish only lineage summaries.
3. **Model and Prompt Design** - Describe behavior and safeguards; redact internal logic (`<redacted>`).
4. **Security and Isolation** - Describe least-privilege, containment, and logging principles only.
5. **Risk and Impact Review** - Document foreseeable failures, mitigations, and rollback triggers.
6. **Testing and Evaluation** - Maintain validation plans; share aggregate, not raw, metrics.
7. **Release Gate** - Require sign-offs from Model Owner, Security Reviewer, and Audit Lead.
8. **Operations and Monitoring** - Describe categories of logs and incident handling at a conceptual level.
9. **Review and Sunsetting** - Schedule periodic audits and archival of decisions.

---

## Evidence and Audit (Research Context)

* Evidence categories: design overview, lineage summary, evaluation aggregates, approval logs.
* Actual evidence files, hashes, and paths remain internal.
* Under PNCRL-1.0 §6, any entity applying this framework must maintain logs of installation, access, and configuration changes within `/evidence/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/`, retained ≥ 180 days for research traceability.

---

## Security Posture (Conceptual)

* Components run with least privilege and isolation.
* All communications assumed encrypted in transit (e.g., TLS 1.3).
* Logging covers governance decisions and access events only—no secrets or PII stored.
* This document provides a **read-only conceptual overview** of security posture; internal configurations are omitted.
